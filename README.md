# All Lang Calc

## Why create this project ?

Compiler principles are fascinating, but my school doesn't teach them, and by the time I learned them, it was quite late. So, I plan to learn them through the classic example of building a four-arithmetic calculator.

I'll try to implement it in every language I've learned; it really has a lot of potential applications.

## what lang will be used ?
