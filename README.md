# All Lang Calc

## Why create this project ?

Compiler principles are fascinating, but my school doesn't teach them, and by the time I learned them, it was quite late. So, I plan to learn them through the classic example of building a four-arithmetic calculator.

I'll try to implement it in every language I've learned; it really has a lot of potential applications (I won't consider using Rust; that would make me faint ðŸ˜«).

## what's will use lang ?

I think...
- Go(near finish)
- Typescript
- Python(maybe very eazy)

## Are you want together commit this project ?
Welcome!, you just create your name folder.
